icebot
======

Multi-functional plugin-extendable IRC bot written in C#. Its target is to bring you one of the most easy-to-configure, easy-to-extend bot with an easy-to-program API.


Before you start anything with the code
=======================================

Make sure to <code>git submodule init</code> / <code>git submodule update</code> before you even try compiling the code. I'm 100% sure you will encounter at least a "file not found" error or some similar stuff.
