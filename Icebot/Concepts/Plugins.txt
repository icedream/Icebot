        Plugins (still to be implemented, thus not working)
        
        This is just here for documentation/keeping track of what is still to do.
        The plugins management will be moved to a database which makes loading
        settings and similar stuff much faster and does not use up the harddisk
        that much (hopefully).
        And it saves me time from coding even.
